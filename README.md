# KYou

Through your webtools, your objects and your collaborations you create a huge
amount of personal data. Unfortunately you can't take advantage of it at its
full potential. That's a pity because you could learn a lot about yourself. To
picture it, let's say that the world of personal data is like an unexplored
land where the entrance is right behind your house.  You know you could enter
it but you don't really know where to go once you are there. It makes you sad
because you are pretty sure that lots of new suprises await you.

KYou is the first steps through this new country. By building analytics from
your [Cozy](http://cozy.io) data, it provides you with the first shape of a
better knowledge of yourself. Kyou aggregates data from your web applications
and displays it as simple charts. With the help of these new insights, you
will learn more about you and improve yourself.

## Trackers

Analytics are built from trackers. There are three kinds of trackers
(only the two first ones have been implemented yet):

* trackers that aggregate data from your Cozy
* trackers that require a daily recording from you
* trackers that aggregate data from outside your Cozy

## Available trackers

**Mood** Store your mood every day and look if there are correlations with
other analytics.

**Task** Count how many tasks were marked done every day. Data comes from 
[Cozy Todos](https://github.com/mycozycloud/cozy-todos)

**Events** Count how many events were listed every day. Data comes from 
[Cozy Calendar](https://github.com/mycozycloud/cozy-calendar)

**Expenses** Count how many money you spent every day. Data comes from 
[Cozy PFM](https://github.com/seeker89/cozy-pfm)

**Steps** Count how many steps you walk every day. Data comes from Jawbone UP.

**Sleep** Count how many minutes you sleep every day. Data comes from Jawbone
UP.

**Tweets** Count how many tweets you published every day. Data comes from Twitter.

**Custrom trackers** The tracker you require, set title and description then go
track your specific stuff.

## What about contributions?

Here are the next things I have mind and not started yet. Your participation to
them would be highly appreciated. Of course any idea is welcome!

* weather tracker: store your location and track temperature and pluviometry.
* github commit tracker: store your daily amount of commits.
* localization/translations
* allow edition for custom trackers
* improve custom trackers amount setter
* ask for confirmation before deleting custrom trackers
* add a comparator tool for data 
* write tests
