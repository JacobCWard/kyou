                Through the webtools you use, your connected objects and simple
                web browsing you create a huge amount of personal data.
                Unfortunately, you can't
                take advantage of it to its full potential. It's a pity
                because you could be learning a lot on yourself. Imagine,
                a world of personal data, an
                unexplored land within your reach.
                You know you could enter it but you probably don't really know
                where to start.

                Kyou displays analytics using
                different kinds of tracker: trackers that require a daily
                recording, trackers that aggregate data from your Cozy apps and
                trackers that aggregate data from other web applications.
