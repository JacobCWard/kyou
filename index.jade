                Through your webtools, your objects and your collaborations you
                create an huge amount of personal data. Unfortunately you can't
                take advantage of it at its full potential. That's a pity
                because it could teach a lot of about yourself. To picture it,
                let's say that the world of personal data is like an
                unexplored land where the entrance is right behind your house.
                You know you could enter into it but you don't really know
                where to go once there. That make you sad because you are
                pretty sure that there are a lot of new suprises awaiting for
                you.
